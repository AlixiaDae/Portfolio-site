With this site, I hope to showcase my skills in front-end development and acquire a job as a junior web developer.

Tasks:
Create a simple yet aesthetically pleasing site that exhibit the little projects I've made from lessons online
Add different pages or employ an interactive style similar to page turning in magazines for a beautiful design
